Note:
'No. of J values' should be an integer
'J values' should be followed with a decimal point if they are integral
The Field strength has to be in Oersted
Temperature and step size values are in Kelvin
all the words used have to be exactly the same since they are used as checkpoint to determine if
that particular information is present in the file or not
