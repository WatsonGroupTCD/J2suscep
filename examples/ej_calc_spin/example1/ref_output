                ********************************
  part of the J2suscep packager for calculating coupling constants
  and magnestic susceptability 
 
  EJ_calc_spin calculates the coupling constants uing calculated (non-integer)
  spins and using the non-singluar solutions of EJ_calc_form   
 
 -------Calculating J values from Spin Densities-------
 This program will use the spin denstities and will not convert the
 spin terms to formal spins.
 If you want to use any kind of spin densities, use this code. An extra
 file 'singul' is required for this to run. This can be generated by
 the code for formal spins. Then run this code
