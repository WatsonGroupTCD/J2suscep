<h1>Contributing</h1>
<h2>Bugs reports and feature requests</h2>

<p>If you think you've found a bug, please report it on the 
<a href="https://github.com/WatsonGroupTCD/J2suscep/issues">Issue Tracker</a>.
You can also propose ideas for new features or ask questions about the design of J2suscep here.
Poor documentation can also be considered a bug, but please be as specific as possible when asking for improvements.</p>


<h2>Code contributions</h2>
<p>We welcome your contributions towards improving and extending the package and this is managed through Github pull requests.
For external contributions we prefer the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">"fork and pull"</a>
workflow while core developers use branches in the main repository:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>First open an Issue to discuss the proposed contribution. This discussion might include how the changes fit J2suscep's scope and a
general technical approach.</li>
<li>Make your own project fork and implement the changes there.</li>
<li>Open a pull request to merge the changes into the main project. A more detailed discussion can take place there before
the changes are accepted.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
