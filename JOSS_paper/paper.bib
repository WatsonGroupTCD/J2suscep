  abstract = {Abstract A new program, PHI, with the ability to calculate the magnetic properties of large spin systems and complex orbitally degenerate systems, such as clusters of d-block and f-block ions, is presented. The program can intuitively fit experimental data from multiple sources, such as magnetic and spectroscopic data, simultaneously. PHI is extensively parallelized and can operate under the symmetric multiprocessing, single process multiple data, or GPU paradigms using a threaded, MPI or GPU model, respectively. For a given problem PHI is been shown to be almost 12 times faster than the well-known program MAGPACK, limited only by available hardware. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Hence{,} theoretical methods based on density functional theory are used because they allow the accurate estimation of such values. Three Mn6 complexes were studied and the calculated exchange coupling constants used to plot a magnetic susceptibility curve that can be compared with the experimental ones. We propose a new tool to facilitate the understanding of the magnetic properties in systems of this kind. We employed magnetostructural maps to correlate the calculated exchange coupling constants with structural parameters for the dinuclear or polynuclear manganese complexes that we have studied.},

abstract="Nature relies on a unique and intricate biochemical setup to achieve sunlight-driven water splitting. Combined experimental and computational efforts have produced significant insights into the structural and functional principles governing the operation of the water-oxidizing enzyme Photosystem II in general, and of the oxygen-evolving manganese--calcium cluster at its active site in particular. Here we review the most important aspects of biological water oxidation, emphasizing current knowledge on the organization of the enzyme, the geometric and electronic structure of the catalyst, and the role of calcium and chloride cofactors. The combination of recent experimental work on the identification of possible substrate sites with computational modeling have considerably limited the possible mechanistic pathways for the critical O--O bond formation step. Taken together, the key features and principles of natural photosynthesis may serve as inspiration for the design, development, and implementation of artificial systems.",

  abstract = {This review provides a detailed account of density functional theory (DFT) and its application to the calculation of molecular properties of inorganic compounds. After introducing some fundamental quantum mechanical concepts, the foundations of DFT and their realization in the framework of the Kohn–Sham construction are described. Following a brief exposition of the computational machinery required to carry out large-scale DFT calculations, the application of analytic derivative theory to DFT is developed in some detail. The cases covered include geometric, electric, magnetic and time-dependent perturbations. The developed theoretical apparatus is then applied to the calculations of molecular structures, vibrational energies as well as a wide variety of properties including absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Finally, the important subjects of spin state energetics and exchange couplings in oligomeric transition metal clusters is discussed.},

  abstract = {Molecular clusters are formed by a finite number of exchange-coupled paramagnetic centers and they are model systems between molecules and extended solids. In order to simulate their properties and extrapolate to solids, the size of the systems to be treated should be as large as possible. In this context, the use of efficient parallel codes is essential. We present the parallel programs ParAni and ParIso, for anisotropic and isotropic models, that enable the calculation of large energy matrices in parallel and the subsequent computation of the relevant spectral information. The evaluation of the matrix elements is based on the serial package Magpack that uses the irreducible tensor operators technique and takes into account all kinds of anisotropic and isotropic magnetic interactions. To obtain the eigenvalues, the energy matrix is partially diagonalized by means of the SLEPc library. The calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these spin clusters enables us to evaluate the bulk magnetic properties (magnetic susceptibility and magnetization) as well as the spectroscopic properties (inelastic neutron scattering spectra). The results are encouraging in terms of parallel efficiency and open the way to address very challenging problems.},

The nature of the various coupling pathways has been determined using a novel methodology that involves perturbing the system while retaining the symmetry and analysing the effect on the coupling strength due to the perturbation. Furthermore{,} we have investigated the magnetic properties of this complex in higher oxidation states which reveals a switch in the nature of coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic in addition to stabilisation of intermediate spin states.},

DFT calculations yield J values, which reproduce the magnetic susceptibility data very well for all four complexes; these studies are also highlighting the likely ageing/stability problems in two of the complexes. It is found that the spin ground states, S, for complexes 1–4 are drastically different, varying from S=29/2 to S=1/2. These values are found to be controlled by the nature of the oxidation state of the metal ions and minor differences present in the structures. Extensive magneto–structural correlations are developed for the seven building unit dimers present in the complexes, with the correlations unlocking the reasons behind the differences in the magnetic properties observed. Independent of the oxidation state of the metal ions, the Mn-O-Mn/Mn-F-Mn angles are found to be the key parameters, which significantly influence the sign as well as the magnitude of the J values. The magneto–structural correlations developed here, have broad applicability and can be utilised to understand the magnetic properties of other Mn clusters.},
