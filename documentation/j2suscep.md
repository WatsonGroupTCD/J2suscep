<h1>J2suscep</h1>

<p> This package can be used to calculate the exchange coupling constants between 
paramagnetic centres and their influence on the temperature dependence of magnetic 
susceptibility for a given system.</p>
<p>This package contains two standalone codes written in FORTRAN 2008 â€“ ej_calc and suscep. 
The ej_calc code uses the spin densities obtained from DFT calculations and determines the 
isotropic exchange coupling between paramagnetic centres. The suscep code calculates the 
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility using the coupling constants.
