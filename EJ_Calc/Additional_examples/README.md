The examples here also correspond to the same {Mn6} complex described in the documentation. In example 2, it can be 
seen from the spin density file (spin_example2) that the Mn centres Mn1, Mn2, Mn4 and Mn5 are in +IV oxidation state 
while Mn3 and Mn6 are in +III oxidation state. This results in significant asymmetry in the complex and the Hamiltonian 
for this complex is provided in the file example2. The files example2_form.txt and example2.txt contain the J-values 
obtained with the use of formal spin density and the spin density from the file spin_example2 respectively.

In example 3, the Mn centres Mn1, Mn2 and Mn4 are in +IV oxidation state while the others are in +III oxidation state 
as seen from the spin density file (spin_example3) again leading to significant asymmetry. The Hamiltonian for this 
complex is provided in the file example3. The files example3_form.txt and example3.txt contain the J-values obtained 
with the use of formal spin density and the spin density from the file spin_example3 respectively.
