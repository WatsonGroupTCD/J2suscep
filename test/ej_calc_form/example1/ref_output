                *          EJ_calc_form        *
                ********************************
  part of the J2suscep packager for calculating coupling constants
  and magnestic susceptability 
 
  EJ_calc_form calculates the coupling constant and singular
  matrices using formal (integer) spins. This singular matrices
  can then be used to assist the calculation of the coupling
  constrants using calcilated (non-integer) spins using EJ_calc
 
 
 -------Calculating J values from Formal Spins-------
 This program will convert spin denstities to formal spins no
 matter what you give and will use the formal spins to solve everything.
 If you want to use spin densities, use a different code. Two extra
 files 'bigg' and 'singul' will also be written. 'singul' is required
 for any code the code that uses the spin densities. The file 'bigg'
  tells you which set of equation has large values (>50 cm-1)
